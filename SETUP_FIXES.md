# JobFlow - Fix Session and Profile Issues

## 🚀 Quick Setup to Fix All Issues

### Step 1: Apply Database Fixes (CRITICAL)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the **entire contents** of `fix_profile_rls.sql`
4. Click "Run" to apply the fixes

### Step 2: Deploy Functions with Environment Variables
```bash
cd /Users/serhatbilge/Downloads/jobflow-ai-assist-8175b1433531e42c046723873873d6ea6a94b1e6

# Deploy all functions with the new environment variables
npx supabase functions deploy
```

### Step 3: Test the Fixes
1. **Profile Saving**: Try saving your profile - should work without "Fehler beim Speichern"
2. **Application Generation**: Try generating an application - should work without "Sitzung abgelaufen"

## 🔧 What These Fixes Do:

### ✅ Session Management
- Added smart session validation that checks expiry time
- Automatically refreshes sessions before they expire
- Better error messages for session issues
- Consistent session handling across the app

### ✅ Database Permissions (RLS)
- Fixed Row Level Security policies for `upsert` operations
- Added proper policies that allow both INSERT and UPDATE
- Improved user creation trigger to prevent conflicts
- Added database index for better performance

### ✅ Environment Variables
- All required API keys are now available to Edge Functions:
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ✅
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` ✅
  - `SUPABASE_URL` ✅

## 🐛 If You Still Get Errors:

### "Sitzung abgelaufen" (Session Expired)
- Check browser console for detailed session logs
- Try signing out and signing in again
- Clear browser cache/cookies for localhost

### "Fehler beim Speichern" (Profile Save Error)
- Make sure you ran the SQL fixes from `fix_profile_rls.sql`
- Check Supabase logs for specific RLS error details

### Application Generation Issues
- Check that Edge Functions deployed successfully
- Verify API keys are set in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions

## 📊 Expected Results:
- **Profile saving**: ✅ Should work immediately
- **Session handling**: ✅ Much more stable, fewer expiration errors
- **Application generation**: ✅ Should work with OpenAI integration
- **Overall app stability**: ✅ Significantly improved

The fixes target the exact root causes of your issues and should resolve them completely!
